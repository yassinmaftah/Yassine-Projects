🛒 CRUD Product Management System

A simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) web application for managing products.
Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this app allows users to create, view, edit, delete, and search products with data persistence using Local Storage.

🚀 Features

✅ Create Product — Add new products with title, price, taxes, ads, discount, count, and category.
✅ Read Product — Display all stored products in a table dynamically.
✅ Update Product — Edit any existing product easily.
✅ Delete Product — Delete one or all products at once.
✅ Search System — Search products by title or category.
✅ Auto Total Calculation — Automatically calculates the total price in real-time.
✅ Local Storage Integration — All data is saved in the browser’s local storage.
✅ Responsive Design — Works well on both desktop and mobile screens.

🧠 How It Works

Fill out the form with product details.

The total is automatically calculated as:

total = price + taxes + ads - discount


Click Create to add the product.

Products are displayed in a table with options to:

Update → Edit the product.

Delete → Remove the product.

Delete All → Clear all saved data.

Use the Search bar to find products by title or category.

🧩 Technologies Used

HTML5 → Structure of the web page

CSS3 → Styling and layout

JavaScript (ES6) → Functionality and DOM manipulation

Local Storage → Data persistence in the browser
